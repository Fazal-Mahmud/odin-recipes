    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
    <li>Toss shrimp with salt and pepper in a large bowl until well combined. 
        Heat a large high-sided skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon sun-dried tomato oil; heat until shimmering, about 2 minutes. Add shrimp in an even layer, and cook until opaque and pink, 3 to 4 minutes, 
        flipping shrimp halfway through cooking time. 
        Transfer shrimp to a large plate.</li>
    <li>Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter with remaining 1 tablespoon sun-dried tomato oil in the same skillet; stir in cherry tomatoes, shallot, garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are soft and shallot is translucent, about 4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir spinach, basil, wine, lemon zest, and crushed red pepper into mixture in skillet; cook over medium, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of skillet, until wine mixture is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream. Reduce heat to low, and add Parmesan cheese; cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is slightly thickened and simmering, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Stir in lemon juice; add cooked shrimp along with any juices from plate. Garnish with additional basil and Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
