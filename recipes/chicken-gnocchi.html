    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Gnocchi</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>Cream Sauce</li>
        
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil and butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Slice chicken breasts in half horizontally to create thin breasts. Sprinkle with seasonings.</li>
        <li>Place chicken in the skillet and cook until golden brown on each side, about 4 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate and keep warm.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, melt butter. Add gnocchi and season with salt and pepper. Cook until gnocchi is golden, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove gnocchi to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add broccoli, zucchini, squash, mushrooms, and bell pepper and season with Italian seasoning. Saute until vegetables are crisp and tender, 5 to 7 minutes, depending on the thickness of the vegetables. Add minced garlic during the last 45 seconds; quickly saute until fragrant. Remove vegetables to the same bowl with gnocchi.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 teaspoons butter in the same skillet; and cook shallot until softened and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Pour in chicken broth, half-and-half, and heavy cream. Whisk in flour, and cook, whisking to prevent lumps, until thickened, about 3 minutes. Squeeze in lemon juice to taste. </li>
        <li>Combine gnocchi and vegetables with cream sauce, and top with cooked chicken.</li>
    </ol>
